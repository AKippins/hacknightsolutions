hacknightsolutions
==================

A compilation of solutions to the hacknight problems. This is meant to be 
a place where everyone can post their own solutions to the problems we pose
during hacknights. Even if you see an answer in the same language you have a 
solution feel free to post yours if it is diffrent enough.

Some basic rules are as follows:
================================
1. The solution should work. It doesn't have to be the shortest or the fastest but it
should work.
2. Comment your solution. Don't worry too much about it making massive amounts
of sense but someone who was unable to solve the problem should be able to follow
your logic.
3. Don't play code golf. It might be great to have the shortest solution when you 
remove every space and use variable names that don't make any sense but this is meant
to be an educational repo and compressing the hell out of your code helps no one.

Open a text file (simply called "t" in the current working directory). For each line in the file, if the first two characters are two spaces, replace them with a single tab character. If the first four characters are four spaces, replace them with two tab characters, and so on. Write the file before quitting.
Language and OS are your own choosing, lowest character count wins.

Triangle Words
====

A triangle number is a number defined as follows: tn = Â½n(n+1). So for example,
the 3rd triangle number is 6 because 6 = 1/2(3)*(3+1). The first few are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55

The value of a word can be calculated by summing the position of all of it's letters
from 1 to 26. An example of calculating a word's value: SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55. So
the value of SKY is 55.

A triangle word a word thats value is a triangle number. SKY happens to be a triangle word
because 55 is the 10th triangle number. 

Write a function that takes in a string and returns true if it is a triangle word. [Source](http://bit.ly/MnToog)

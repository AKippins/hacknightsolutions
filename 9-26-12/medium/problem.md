Sexy Primes
====

Write a function that generates the first n sexy prime numbers.

A sexy prime is a pair of numbers such that when summed they equal another
prime number. For example the pair (2,3) is a sexy prime pair because
2 + 3 = 5. So a prime number, 2, plus another prime number, 3, equals a 
third prime number, 5. [source](http://bit.ly/QOeAVh).
